While I did have problems with the App on my mobile device initially one phone call to a technician solved the glitch. The techs are wizards and every interaction I have had with customer service has been delightful.

442,love this app live what's on it and it's perfect for family fun night
443,True to the original source material. Love the fourth-wall breaks. Tatiana Maslany also an excellent casting choice.
444,"Not the greatest company or organization publicly. Disney internally could do better but they lost there touch with the whole family enjoyment aspect. Disney does not care about there people or the public just profit shares and PROFIT. I hope the image of the Disney corporation does better in the future. Family oriented it is NOT. And everyone around the world has always loved Disney, that's just not the case no more at this time but there's always HOPE."
